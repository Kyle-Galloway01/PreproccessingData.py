# Data Preprocessing Script

## Overview
This Python script performs basic preprocessing on a CSV file containing data. It loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame, handles missing values, and performs any necessary data transformations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the Pandas library installed.
3. Place your CSV data file in the same directory as the script, or specify the correct file path in the `csv_file` variable within the script.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the script and the CSV file.
6. Run the script by executing the command `python preprocessing.py`.
7. The script will load the CSV data, preprocess it, and print the processed DataFrame.

## Example
Suppose you have a CSV file named `data.csv` containing your data. To preprocess this data using the script, you would run:
